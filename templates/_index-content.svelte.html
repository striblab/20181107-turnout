      <p>Now that 2018's election is certified, new data from the Minnesota Secretary of State paints a clearer picture of where increased voter enthusiasm helped drive a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/nearly-2-6-million-minnesotans-turn-out-setting-midterm-participation-record/499984031/">record 2.6 million Minnesotans to the polls</a>, reversing years of Minnesota's sliding turnout during midterms.</p>
    
      <p>Surges in participation among those aged 18-to-34, a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-people-have-already-voted-in-minnesota-here-s-what-we-re-watching/489888171/">strong early vote</a> and political shifts in the state's suburbs and rural areas all indicated a electorate more enthused to vote this year than in 2014.</p>

      <p>Here are some indicators of how motivation among voters impacted Minnesota's electorate this year:</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Turnout was more on par with presidential years</h2>
      <p>About 64 percent of eligible Minnesota voters cast ballots on and before Election Day, the state's highest midterm turnout since 2002.</p>

      <p>After several years of gradually decreasing, Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">midterm election turnout</span> bounced back by about 13 percent, much closer to the state's typical <span class="legendary gray3">presidential election year turnout</span>.</p>

  <section class="container-lg">
      <p>Additionally, this year's early vote nearly matched 2016's numbers and surpassed 2014 nearly three times over. New voter registrations spiked this year as well.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Metro enthusiasm boosted turnout</h2>
      <p>Increases in turnout — shaded from <span class="legendary purple1">less</span> to <span class="legendary purple3">more</span>, except where it <span class="legendary orange2">decreased</span> — were most pronounced in the Twin Cities and its suburbs compared to 2014, particularly Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

      <p>High turnout in those Democratic strongholds helped many DFL candidates win their statewide races.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, greater suburban turnout shifted those districts from Republican to Democratic. Minnesota's suburban District Three lead the country in turnout among Congressional districts this year, while metro Districts Five and Two also placed in the top ten.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Young voters tipped the scales</h2>
      <p>Election handicappers watched the youth vote closely due to Minnesota being one of several competitive states <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-youth-could-affect-key-november-elections-if-they-turn-out/480720341/">most susceptible to a surge of voters aged 18-to-34</a>.</p>

      <p><span class="legendary purple3">Voter turnout</span> was highest among X and increased most dramatically among X and X compared to 2014 and 2016.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Minnesota leads national turnout</h2>
      <p>Minnesota emerged as the national leader in <span class="legendary purple3">voter turnout</span>, adding to a streak that started in 2014.</p>

      <p>States like Colorado, Montana and Oregon also lead the pack, while Arkansas, Mississippi and Hawaii had among the lowest voter turnout in the country.</p>

  <section class="container-lg">
      <p>Same-day registration, revised early voting laws and a general culture of civic engagement <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-had-the-nation-s-highest-voter-turnout-again-here-s-one-reason-why/416247753/">have kept Minnesota in the upper echelons of voter turnout</a> for years.</p>

      <p>As more states look to Minnesota and adopt similar measures to ease the voting process in the future, its place atop the stack might someday be challenged.</p>
