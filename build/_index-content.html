      <h1>How Minnesota's midterm turnout bounced back</h1>

      <p>After last night's election, Minnesota once again emerged as the national leader in voter turnout with XX% of the state's registered voters turning up to the polls.</p>

      <p>This stems the slide of Minnesota's gradual decline in midterm turnout, placing it more on par with its strong turnout during presidential election years</p>

      <p>A primary driver was record-setting new voter registrations, especially among those aged 18-to-34, who cast ballots in numbers unseen in previous Minnesota midterms.</p>

      <p>This was preceded by a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-people-have-already-voted-in-minnesota-here-s-what-we-re-watching/489888171/">strong early vote</a> for about six weeks leading up to the midterm with the number of accepted absentee ballots matching 2016's total and far surpassing 2014's.</p>

      <p>Youth turnout was being watched closely due Minnesota being one of several competitive states more susceptible to a surge of voters aged 18-to-34.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">How Minnesota ranks nationally</h2>
      <p>Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">voter turnout</span> leads the country once again, adding to a streak that started in 2014.</p>

      <p>States like New Hampshire, Maine and Wisconsin also lead the pack, while Hawaii, Utah and California once again have the lowest voter turnout in the country.</p>

      <p>Same-day registration, revised early voting laws and a general culture of civic engagement <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-had-the-nation-s-highest-voter-turnout-again-here-s-one-reason-why/416247753/">have kept Minnesota in the upper echelons of voter turnout</a> for years.</p>

      <p>As more states look to Minnesota and adopt similar measures in the future, its place atop the stack might someday be challenged. But for now, Minnesota remains the undisputed leader in voter turnout.</p>
