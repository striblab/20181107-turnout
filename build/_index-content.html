      <p>Following this year's election, Minnesota once again emerged as the national leader in voter turnout with 64 percent of those registered casting ballots – the state's highest midterm turnout since 2002.</p>

      <p>Increased voter enthusiasm helped drive a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/nearly-2-6-million-minnesotans-turn-out-setting-midterm-participation-record/499984031/">record 2.6 million Minnesotans to the polls</a>, reversing years of Minnesota's sliding turnout during midterm elections.</p>

      <p>Enthusiasm can be measured a number of ways, including record-setting new voter registrations among those aged 18-to-34, a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-people-have-already-voted-in-minnesota-here-s-what-we-re-watching/489888171/">strong early vote</a> that virtually matched 2016's and political shifts in the suburb and rural parts of the state.</p>

      <p>Here are some indicators of how Minnesota's midterm turnout bounced back:</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Turnout was more on par with presidential years</h2>
      <p>After several years of gradually decreasing, Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">midterm election turnout</span> bounced back by 13 percent, much closer to the state's typical <span class="legendary gray3">presidential election year turnout</span>.</p>

      <p>Despite Minnesota's decreasing engagement during midterms before this year, it often still managed to lead the country in voter turnout.</p>

      <p>But this year also saw sizable increases in voter registrations and early voting compared to 2014, making it an outsized midterm for voter turnout.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Suburban enthusiasm boosted turnout</h2>
      <p>Turnout — displayed shaded from <span class="legendary purple1">less</span> to <span class="legendary purple3">more</span> was highest in the Twin Cities metro area, particularly Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

      <p>Among greater Minnesota counties, voters in the south showed up big in areas won handily by DFL candidate Tim Walz.</p>

    <p>And per usual, the Twin Cities metro area lead the state in voter turnout. High turnout in Democratic strongholds like Hennepin and Ramsey counties helped DFL candidates win their statewide races.</p>
    <p>Similarly, boosts in voter turnout in Dakota County may have played a significant role in flipping District Three from Republican to Democatic control.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">How Minnesota ranks nationally</h2>
      <p>Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">voter turnout</span> leads the country once again, adding to a streak that started in 2014.</p>

      <p>States like New Hampshire, Maine and Wisconsin also lead the pack, while Hawaii, Utah and California once again have the lowest voter turnout in the country.</p>

  <section class="container-lg">
      <p>Same-day registration, revised early voting laws and a general culture of civic engagement <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-had-the-nation-s-highest-voter-turnout-again-here-s-one-reason-why/416247753/">have kept Minnesota in the upper echelons of voter turnout</a> for years.</p>

      <p>As more states look to Minnesota and adopt similar measures in the future, its place atop the stack might someday be challenged. But for now, Minnesota remains the undisputed leader in voter turnout.</p>
