      <p>Now that 2018's election is certified and in the books, it's clearer how increased voter enthusiasm helped drive a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/nearly-2-6-million-minnesotans-turn-out-setting-midterm-participation-record/499984031/">record 2.6 million Minnesotans to the polls</a>, reversing years of Minnesota's sliding turnout during midterms.</p>
    
      <p>Enthusiasm can be measured a number of ways, including record-setting new voter registrations among those aged 18-to-34, a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-people-have-already-voted-in-minnesota-here-s-what-we-re-watching/489888171/">strong early vote</a> and political shifts in the state's suburbs and rural areas.</p>

      <p>Here are some indicators of how motivation among voters impacted Minnesota's electorate this year:</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Turnout was more on par with presidential years</h2>
      <p>About 64 percent of eligible Minnesota voters cast ballots on and before Election Day – which reaches the state's highest midterm turnout since 2002.</p>

      <p>After several years of gradually decreasing, Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">midterm election turnout</span> bounced back by 13 percent, much closer to the state's typical <span class="legendary gray3">presidential election year turnout</span>.</p>

      <p>Despite Minnesota's decreasing engagement during midterms before this year, it often still managed to lead the country in voter turnout.</p>

      <p>But this year's early vote nearly matched 2016's numbers and surpassed 2014 nearly three times over.</p>
      
      <p>New voter registrations also spiked this year, suggesting higher levels of voter engagement than the previous midterm.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Metro enthusiasm boosted turnout</h2>
      <p>Increases in turnout — shaded from <span class="legendary purple1">less</span> to <span class="legendary purple3">more</span>, except where it <span class="legendary orange2">decreased</span> — were most pronounced in the Twin Cities and its suburbs compared to 2014, particularly Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

      <p>Greater turnout in the suburbs and southern parts of the state may have played a key role in those seats flipping parties.</p>

    <p>Once again, the metro area lead the state in voter turnout overal. High turnout in Democratic strongholds like Hennepin and Ramsey counties helped DFL candidates win their statewide races.</p>

    <p>Similarly, boosted voter turnout in Dakota County may have played a significant role in flipping District Two from Republican to Democatic control.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Young voters tipped the scales</h2>
      <p>Election handicappers watched the youth vote closely due to Minnesota being one of several competitive states <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-youth-could-affect-key-november-elections-if-they-turn-out/480720341/">most susceptible to a surge of voters aged 18-to-34</a>.</p>

      <p><span class="legendary purple3">Voter turnout</span> was highest among X and increased most dramatically among X and X compared to 2014 and 2016.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Minnesota's turnout once again leads the country</h2>
      <p>Minnesota emerged as the national leader in <span class="legendary purple3">voter turnout</span>, adding to a streak that started in 2014.</p>

      <p>States like Colorado, Wisconsin and Oregon also lead the pack, while Louisiana, Hawaii and Utah once again had among the lowest voter turnout in the country.</p>

  <section class="container-lg">
      <p>Same-day registration, revised early voting laws and a general culture of civic engagement <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-had-the-nation-s-highest-voter-turnout-again-here-s-one-reason-why/416247753/">have kept Minnesota in the upper echelons of voter turnout</a> for years.</p>

      <p>As more states look to Minnesota and adopt similar measures to ease the voting process in the future, its place atop the stack might someday be challenged.</p>
