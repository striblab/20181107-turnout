      <p>Minnesota once again emerged as the national leader in voter turnout this election season with 64 percent of those registered casting ballots – the state's highest midterm turnout since 2002.</p>

      <p>Increased voter enthusiasm helped drive a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/nearly-2-6-million-minnesotans-turn-out-setting-midterm-participation-record/499984031/">record 2.6 million Minnesotans to the polls</a>, reversing years of Minnesota's sliding turnout during midterm elections.</p>

      <p>Enthusiasm can be measured a number of ways, including record-setting new voter registrations among those aged 18-to-34, a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-people-have-already-voted-in-minnesota-here-s-what-we-re-watching/489888171/">strong early vote</a> and political shifts in the state's suburbs and rural areas.</p>

      <p>Here are some indicators of voter enthusiasm in Minnesota's electorate this year:</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Turnout was more on par with presidential years</h2>
      <p>After several years of gradually decreasing, Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">midterm election turnout</span> bounced back by 13 percent, much closer to the state's typical <span class="legendary gray3">presidential election year turnout</span>.</p>

      <p>Despite Minnesota's decreasing engagement during midterms before this year, it often still managed to lead the country in voter turnout.</p>

      <p>But this year's early vote nearly matched 2016's numbers and dwarfed 2014 nearly three times over.</p>
      
      <p>New voter registrations also spiked this year, suggesting higher levels of voter engagement than the previous midterm.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Metro enthusiasm boosted turnout</h2>
      <p>Turnout — shaded from <span class="legendary purple1">less</span> to <span class="legendary purple3">more</span> where it increased, unless it <span class="legendary orange2">decreased</span> – increased most in the Twin Cities and its suburbs compared to 2014, particularly Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

      <p>Greater turnout in the suburbs and southern parts of the state may have played a key role in those seats flipping parties.</p>

    <p>And per usual, the Twin Cities metro area lead the state in voter turnout. High turnout in Democratic strongholds like Hennepin and Ramsey counties helped DFL candidates win their statewide races.</p>

    <p>Similarly, boosts in voter turnout in Dakota County may have played a significant role in flipping District Three from Republican to Democatic control.</p>

      <p>Election handicappers watched the youth vote closely due to Minnesota being one of several competitive states most susceptible to a surge of voters aged 18-to-34.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">How Minnesota ranks nationally</h2>
      <p>Minnesota's <span class="legendary purple3">voter turnout</span> leads the country once again, adding to a streak that started in 2014.</p>

      <p>States like Colorado, Wisconsin and Oregon also lead the pack, while Louisiana, Hawaii and Utah once again had among the lowest voter turnout in the country.</p>

  <section class="container-lg">
      <p>Same-day registration, revised early voting laws and a general culture of civic engagement <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-had-the-nation-s-highest-voter-turnout-again-here-s-one-reason-why/416247753/">have kept Minnesota in the upper echelons of voter turnout</a> for years.</p>

      <p>As more states look to Minnesota and adopt similar measures to ease the voting process in the future, its place atop the stack might someday be challenged.</p>
